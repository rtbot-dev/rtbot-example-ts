# rtbot-example-ts

This is a minimalist example project about how to use `RtBot` in a typescript, specifically in a node application.

## How to run

First install the dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
# or your package manager of preference
```

Then execute the `start` script:

```bash
pnpm start
# or pnpm run start or the equivalent with `yarn` or `npm`
```

This will run a small program that computes the moving average of the signal passed.
